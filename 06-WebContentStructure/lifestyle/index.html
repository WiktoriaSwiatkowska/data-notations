            <ol>
                <li>Eat a balanced diet: Base meals on high-fiber starchy carbohydrates, and include plenty of fruits and vegetables.</li>
                <li>Avoid sugary drinks: Drink water instead of soft drinks, soda, and sugary juices.</li>
                <li>Aim for 150 minutes of activity: Get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, like brisk walking, per week.</li>
                <li>Hydrate during exercise: Drink fluids before, during, and after your workout to prevent dehydration. Drink about 2–3 cups of water in the 2–3 hours before a workout, and then 1/2–1 cup every 15–20 minutes during.</li>
